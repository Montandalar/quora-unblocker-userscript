# [Quora unblocker userscript](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/159399)

[Userscript](http://wiki.greasespot.net/User_script) that removes the Quora login requirement and any nagging about it.

Quora recently added a way to view content [without logging in](http://blog.quora.com/Making-Sharing-Better) by appending `?share=1` to the url. This userscript appends that to every Quora url you visit in addition to removing some annoying login nags.
